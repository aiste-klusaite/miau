# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# How to run application

1. Clone repository
2. run npm install in both directories (Backend and outside);

Thereafter, you can start the dummy backend API server via "npm start" (inside the "backend-api" folder).
The React app dev server is then also started via "npm start" (though inside the "react-frontend" folder).

The dummy backend API does not use any external database - instead the dummy data is saved to an "events.json" file inside the project folder.
